# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Simple E-Commerce React App

This is a simple e-commerce application built using React. The application allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and simulate a checkout process. It fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays products with pagination/infinite scrolling.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add and remove products from the shopping cart.
- **Cart Summary**: Shows the total number of items and total price.
- **Checkout Simulation**: Includes a form for entering name, address, and payment details (no real payment processing).

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, styled using Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used
